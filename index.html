First up is Molayo Sobande, a student who will now be pursuing computer science as a major. She said, “Being a part of BreakThroughTechMiami, I went from being a somewhat timid public speaker with no solidified background knowledge of computer science to confidently presenting an app that my team and I made in just three days”. Next is Sophia, a biology major surprised and proud of making a self-portrait through coding at Guild Workshop. Lastly we have FIU Alumni, Neica Sainvilus, who is now working at AMEX as a full-time software engineer because of BTT's Sprintern Program! Ladies, your journey in tech can start here! Each story is a reminder that you have a place in this field. Join us at FIU, where we empower each other to thrive, innovate, and break barriers. Together, we can create a diverse and inclusive tech community. Let’s embark on this adventure together!";
